Does Spotify or Soundcloud allow external applications to query music streaming on behalf of a user?
    Both Spotify and Soundcloud offer a Web API for use in developing 3rd party applications that connect 
    with spotify. This includes the ability to stream music from the platforms with Spotify having some 
    reasonable limitations; Such as you cannot distribute the music beyond the player, and cannot use the 
    api to broadcast the music.

Does Spotify or Soundcloud allow users to Sign-In to their accounts through a third party application?
    Both offer the ability for users to sign in to their accounts through the third party application.

When Signed-In, what, if any, features become available to users?
    Soundcloud offers abilities to signed-in users, such as creating playlists or uploading songs. For our
    purpose this doesn't seem too important. Spotify offers more abilities for signeed in users; such as
    getting their top artists/content and getting artists followed by the user.

Would there be any fees associated with making a third party integration of their software?
    Both web API's are offered free of charge.

Which Software provides better features and simple integration?
    Spotify offers a more detailed documentation. In addition, the features available seem more relevant to
    our use-case of users simply listening to music. Soundcloud offers more features for users who want to 
    upload their own music.
