Questions to be answered: 
* What are the main features the music player aims to offer beyond basic functionalities? 
Music player will allow users to play, pause, go to next song, go to previous song, increase, decrease volume which are essential features.

This command will make robot play next song from the que of the music player. 
* How will the music player handle large playlists or libraries? Are there any plans for cross-platform support? 
Music player is designed to use spotify IOS sdk and Web API to fetch request to play music on the users command. There’s no plans on cross platform, our app is specifically for IOS.

Spotify API and SDK will update everytime there’s new call from the user.

Spotify is very secure with it’s API’s. However, there is known vulnerability that if someone get’s on your network then they can reverse the call path from API to perform their own operations. 


* Are there any potential conflicts between the licenses of different libraries? 
No, since we are going to stick with one player, there won’t be any issues.
