What are the best chatting models?
LLaMA, ChatSpot, Chat GPT, Bard, Jasper

How can we modify these models to interact with a camera feed and identify what we want?
To modify these models to interact with a camera feed, we have to change the "source" that the model is 
looking at for the images that it is analyzing.  This can be done createing a stream from the camera and
setting it as the input feed.

What are the bare minimum requirements for running this model?
The bare minimum requirements depend on which model.  For the advance models we would need to use cloud computing.
For something more simple like  LLaMA, we could run on a raspberry pi if optimized correctly.  


Can we optimize these models to work on a less efficient system?
Using techniques like pruning and compression, we can have these models work on a less efficient system


How can we extend Chat GPT or a similar model to chat about things in the camera feed?
We can create a plugin to tailor Chat GPT for our purposes

What are the best computer vision models?
ResNet, DenseNet, Inception

How can we modify these models to identify exactly what we want?
We can prompt the models with certain things we want to identify and train
them off of these objects

What are the bare minimum requirements for running this model?
The bare minimum requirements depend on which model.  For the advance models we would need to use cloud computing.
For something more simple like  LLaMA, we could run on a raspberry pi if optimized correctly.  

Can we optimize these models to work on a less efficient system?
Using techniques like pruning and compression, we can have these models work on a less efficient system

How accurate can these models be?
Model accuracy varies depending on the model.  They vary from 85% accurate to 60% accurate
